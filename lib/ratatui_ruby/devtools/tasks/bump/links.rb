# Manages the version comparison links at the botton of the changelog.
#
# Release automation needs to update links. Manually calculating git diff URLs
# for every release is tedious and error-prone. SourceHut does not have
# standard comparison views, complicating matters further.
#
# This class manages the collection of links. It parses them from the markdown.
# It generates the correct tree links for SourceHut. It properly shifts the
# "Unreleased" pointer.
#
# Use it to update the changelog during a release.

  # wasteful. This pattern finds where the links begin.
